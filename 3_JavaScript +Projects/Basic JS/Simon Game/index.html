        <p>The Simon Says Game challenges your memory skills. To play, start by pressing any key to begin. The game will display a sequence of colors. Your task is to replicate this sequence by clicking on the colors in the same order. Each successful replication advances you to the next level with an added color to the sequence. If you make a mistake and fail to replicate the sequence correctly, the game ends. Keep going to beat your high score and test your memory!</p>
